# Basic NLP Project
## This project was just an example project to understand how NLP works. 

### Rules are simple just run the first block of the Jupyter Notebook to install spACy library 
### The other text file is sort of a dataset change accordingly your liking
### Run the second block of the Jupyter Notebook and see how I used NLP to extract information from the data where there were no headers!
